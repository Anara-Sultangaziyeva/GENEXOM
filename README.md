# GENEXOM
The file is the result of annotation of medical text in the Label Studio system and is part of the corpus dedicated to the analysis of genetic information in Russian. The text contains references to genes (EP300, TREX1, CFTR, BRCA1), DNA variants (chr22:41160723G>A, chr3:48466792G>GC), mutation types (reading frame shift, deletion, insertion), HGVS notation (c.3671+1G>A, p.Thr49fs, c.144dupC), levels of clinical significance (Pathogenic, Likely pathogenic, Uncertain), associated diseases (Gitelman syndrome, Menke-Hennekam syndrome 2), types of inheritance (AD, AR, dominant, recessive), as well as a link to the OMIM database (http://omim.org/entry/618333 ) and a short text explanation with a recommendation for interpretation ("A phenotype comparison is recommended...Â»).

The abstract is made manually and covers the following types of entities: GENE (genes), VARIANT_LOC (genomic coordinates of variants), MUTATION_TYPE (type of mutation), CDNA_PROT (variant notation at the cDNA/protein level), PATHOGENICITY (clinical significance), DISEASE (disease name), INHERITANCE (type of inheritance), OMIM_LINK (link to OMIM database entry), RECOMMENDATION (text recommendation). Each text fragment is assigned one or more corresponding labels.
